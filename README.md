# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

## Every year choose a programming language from this list

## Rules:
1. No external help: ChatGPT does not exist. You need to learn to walk before you can run.
2. Think before coding: I will read the problem and brainstorm solutions during my commute, without coding.
3. Plan the architecture first: I will write a "main" function with the functions I want to call, then create them.
4. Test before finalizing: I will write a test to ensure the example result is correct before applying it to the final solution.
5. Start with brute force: Begin with the simplest, most straightforward solution. If time permits, I will refine it.
6. Complete code before running: I
7. No external libraries
8. Part 2 is executed from scratch (meaning it recomputes part 1 if necessary)
